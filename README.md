# Modern IOS App Infrastructure &mdash; Sample Project

This project is meant to follow along with Paul Hudson's [tutorial series on Modern App Infrastructure](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/94/how-to-refactor-your-app-to-add-unit-tests).

It starts with an app called `Paraphrase`, which has a structure that the [initial README](https://github.com/twostraws/Paraphrase/blob/40b438646abebdc427011196d9180769c5c48708/README.md) describes as "clumsy but in a realistic way – it’s the kind of app you might build if you didn’t know better".

I copied the contents of the starter project to this repo so I can commit each part of the evolution.
